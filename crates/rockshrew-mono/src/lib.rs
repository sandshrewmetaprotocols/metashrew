//! # Rockshrew-Mono: Monolithic Bitcoin Indexer
//!
//! ## OVERVIEW
//!
//! `rockshrew-mono` is a monolithic binary that combines a Bitcoin indexer and a view layer
//! into a single, efficient application. It leverages a generic, adapter-based synchronization
//! framework to provide flexibility and testability.
//!
//! ## ARCHITECTURE
//!
//! The application is built on the `metashrew-sync` crate, which provides a generic
//! `SnapshotMetashrewSync` engine. This engine is configured with adapters for:
//!
//! - **Bitcoin Node**: `BitcoinRpcAdapter` for connecting to a Bitcoin Core node.
//! - **Storage**: `RocksDBStorageAdapter` for persistent storage using RocksDB.
//! - **Runtime**: `MetashrewRuntimeAdapter` for executing WASM-based indexers.
//!
//! This modular design allows for easy replacement of components, such as using an
//! in-memory storage adapter for testing.
//!
//! ## CORE FUNCTIONALITY
//!
//! - **Indexing**: Synchronizes with the Bitcoin blockchain, processing blocks through a
//!   WASM indexer and storing the resulting state in RocksDB.
//! - **View Layer**: Exposes a JSON-RPC API for querying the indexed state.
//! - **Snapshotting**: Supports creating and consuming snapshots for fast synchronization.
//! - **Reorg Handling**: Automatically detects and handles blockchain reorganizations.
//!
//! ## USAGE
//!
//! `rockshrew-mono` is configured and run via command-line arguments. See `Args` for a
//! full list of options.

// In-code documentation for `rockshrew-mono` crate.
//
// PURPOSE:
// This crate serves as the main entry point for the `rockshrew-mono` binary. It is
// responsible for parsing command-line arguments, setting up the synchronization
// engine, and running the JSON-RPC server.
//
// PROMPT CONSIDERATIONS:
// - The primary goal is to refactor this crate to be a lightweight, generic
//   implementation of the indexer stack.
// - All duplicated logic should be moved to lower-level crates like `metashrew-sync`.
// - The `run` function should be generic over the adapter traits to support both
//   production (RocksDB) and testing (in-memory) environments.

///
/// Pure function (no I/O, no async) that computes the next half-open
/// `[fetch_start, fetch_end)` range the prefetcher should fetch. Tested
/// directly without spinning up the full fetcher loop.
///
/// ## The bug this guards against
///
/// In v9.0.5-rc.5 the fetcher computed `fetch_start =
/// engine.current_height()` every loop iteration. The engine's
/// `current_height` is the PROCESSOR's committed tip — it lags behind
/// what the fetcher has already enqueued. When the processor was slow
/// (e.g. a single block taking 90 seconds to apply), the fetcher would
/// loop, re-read the unchanged `current_height = N`, and re-enqueue the
/// same range `[N, N+prefetch_size)`. Once the processor caught up, it
/// would see (and try to commit) the duplicate `N` AFTER the original
/// `N..N+prefetch_size-1` had already been committed, hitting the
/// rc.3 strict-in-order check in `commit_atomic` and looping forever
/// in the rc.3 infinite-retry backoff.
///
/// ## Invariants enforced
///
/// 1. The fetcher MUST NOT send the same height twice consecutively.
/// 2. The fetcher MUST NOT send a height below the processor's tip
///    (the processor would reject it).
/// 3. Following a rollback (the processor's tip drops because a reorg
///    handler rewound it), the fetcher MUST resume fetching from the
///    new tip — `last_sent_height` is reset down to `LAST_SENT_UNSET`
///    by the rollback path.
///
/// ## Arguments
///
/// * `processor_tip` — the processor's committed tip
///   (`engine.current_height()`).
/// * `last_sent` — the height of the most recent block the fetcher
///   successfully sent to the channel, or `LAST_SENT_UNSET` (-1) if
///   the fetcher hasn't sent anything yet OR if a rollback reset it.
/// * `prefetch_size` — the max number of blocks per batch.
/// * `remote_tip` — the bitcoind tip height.
///
/// ## Return
///
/// `Some((start, end))` — a half-open range of heights to fetch this
/// iteration, or `None` if there's nothing new to fetch
/// (caller should sleep and retry).
