//! Core WebAssembly runtime for executing Bitcoin indexers
//!
//! This module provides the main [`MetashrewRuntime`] struct that executes WebAssembly
//! modules for Bitcoin block processing. It implements the host side of the WASM
//! interface, providing functions that WASM modules can call to interact with the
//! database and retrieve blockchain data.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The runtime follows a generic design pattern where it's parameterized over a
//! storage type `T: KeyValueStoreLike`. This enables:
//!
//! - **Testing**: Use in-memory storage for fast unit tests
//! - **Production**: Use RocksDB for persistent, high-performance storage
//! - **Flexibility**: Support for future storage backends
//!
//! # Key Components
//!
//! ## WASM Execution Environment
//!
//! The runtime uses Wasmtime to execute WebAssembly modules with:
//! - **Deterministic execution**: Configured for reproducible results
//! - **Memory isolation**: Each block execution starts with fresh memory
//! - **Resource limits**: Configurable memory and execution limits
//! - **Host function bindings**: Provides database and I/O operations to WASM
//!
//! ## Host Functions
//!
//! The runtime provides these functions to WASM modules:
//! - `__host_len()`: Get input data length
//! - `__load_input(ptr)`: Load block data into WASM memory
//! - `__get(key_ptr, value_ptr)`: Read from database
//! - `__get_len(key_ptr)`: Get value length for a key
//! - `__flush(data_ptr)`: Write key-value pairs to database
//! - `__log(ptr)`: Output debug messages
//!
//! ## Execution Modes
//!
//! The runtime supports multiple execution modes:
//! - **Normal**: Standard block processing with database writes
//! - **View**: Read-only execution for querying state
//! - **Preview**: Isolated execution for testing block effects
//! - **Atomic**: Batch processing with rollback capability
//!
//! # Example Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use metashrew_runtime::{MetashrewRuntime, traits::KeyValueStoreLike};
//! use std::path::PathBuf;
//!
//! async fn process_blocks<T: KeyValueStoreLike>(
//!     mut runtime: MetashrewRuntime<T>,
//!     block_data: &[u8],
//!     height: u32
//! ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!     // Process a block
//!     runtime.process_block(height, block_data).await?;
//!
//!     // Query the resulting state
//!     let state_root = runtime.get_state_root(height).await?;
//!     println!("State root: {}", hex::encode(state_root));
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//! ```

/// Core WebAssembly runtime for executing Bitcoin indexers
///
/// [`MetashrewRuntime`] is the main execution engine that runs WebAssembly modules
/// for Bitcoin block processing. It's generic over storage backends, enabling
/// flexible deployment scenarios from testing to production.
///
/// # Type Parameters
///
/// - `T`: Storage backend implementing [`KeyValueStoreLike`] + [`Clone`] + [`Send`] + [`Sync`]
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// The runtime maintains both synchronous and asynchronous execution engines:
/// - **Synchronous engine**: Used for block processing and preview operations
/// - **Asynchronous engine**: Used for view functions and cooperative yielding
///
/// # Key Components
///
/// ## Execution Context
/// - `context`: Shared state including database, block data, and execution height
/// - `wasmstore`: WASM execution store with resource limits and failure tracking
///
/// ## WASM Engines
/// - `engine`: Synchronous Wasmtime engine for block processing
/// - `async_engine`: Asynchronous Wasmtime engine for view functions
/// - `module`: Compiled WASM module for synchronous execution
/// - `async_module`: Compiled WASM module for asynchronous execution
///
/// ## Host Interface
/// - `linker`: Provides host functions to WASM modules
/// - `instance`: Instantiated WASM module ready for execution
///
/// # Execution Modes
///
/// ## Block Processing (`run`)
/// Normal block processing with database writes and state updates:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// runtime.run()?; // Process current block
/// ```
///
/// ## View Functions (`view`)
/// Read-only execution for querying historical state:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = runtime.view("get_balance".to_string(), &input, height).await?;
/// ```
///
/// ## Preview Mode (`preview`)
/// Isolated execution for testing block effects without committing:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let result = runtime.preview(&block_data, "view_function".to_string(), &input, height)?;
/// ```
///
/// ## Atomic Processing (`process_block_atomic`)
/// Batch processing with rollback capability:
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let atomic_result = runtime.process_block_atomic(height, &block_data, &block_hash).await?;
/// ```
///
/// # Memory Management
///
/// The runtime supports persistent memory between blocks and view calls:
/// - **Memory persistence**: WASM memory state is retained between normal block processing
/// - **Stateful views**: WASM memory persists between view calls (enabled by default)
/// - **Resource limits**: Pre-allocated maximum memory to avoid growth
/// - **LRU cache**: metashrew-core redesign prevents unbounded memory growth
/// - **Reorg refresh**: Memory is only refreshed during chain reorganizations
///
/// # Thread Safety
///
/// All shared state is protected by [`Arc<Mutex<_>>`] for safe concurrent access.
/// The runtime can be safely shared across threads for parallel view operations.
///
/// # Example Usage
