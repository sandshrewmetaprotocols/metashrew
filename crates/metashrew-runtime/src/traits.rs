//! Core traits for generic key-value storage backends
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental traits that enable Metashrew to work with
//! different storage backends in a generic way. The primary traits are:
//!
//! - [`KeyValueStoreLike`]: The main storage interface that abstracts database operations
//! - [`BatchLike`]: Interface for atomic batch operations
//! - [`AtomicBlockResult`]: Result type for atomic block processing
//!
//! These traits enable dependency injection and allow Metashrew to work with
//! RocksDB, in-memory stores, or other key-value databases without changing
//! the core runtime logic.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! The storage layer follows a generic design pattern where the runtime is
//! parameterized over a storage type `T: KeyValueStoreLike`. This allows:
//!
//! - **Testing**: Use in-memory stores for fast unit tests
//! - **Production**: Use RocksDB for persistent, high-performance storage
//! - **Future extensibility**: Add support for other databases like DynamoDB
//!
//! # Key-Value Tracking
//!
//! The storage layer includes optional key-value tracking functionality that
//! enables features like:
//!
//! - **Snapshots**: Track changes for efficient snapshot creation
//! - **Chain reorganizations**: Identify affected keys during reorgs
//! - **Auditing**: Maintain a complete history of state changes

/// Trait for atomic batch operations on key-value stores
///
/// This trait defines the interface for collecting multiple database operations
/// into a single atomic batch that can be committed all at once. This is essential
/// for maintaining database consistency during block processing.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use metashrew_runtime::traits::BatchLike;
///
/// fn example_batch_usage<B: BatchLike>(mut batch: B) {
///     // Add multiple operations to the batch
///     batch.put(b"key1", b"value1");
///     batch.put(b"key2", b"value2");
///     batch.delete(b"old_key");
///
///     // Batch will be committed when passed to storage.write()
/// }
/// ```
pub trait BatchLike {
    /// Add a key-value pair to the batch
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `key` - The key to store (any type that can be converted to bytes)
    /// * `value` - The value to store (any type that can be converted to bytes)
    fn put<K: AsRef<[u8]>, V: AsRef<[u8]>>(&mut self, key: K, value: V);

    /// Mark a key for deletion in the batch
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// * `key` - The key to delete (any type that can be converted to bytes)
    fn delete<K: AsRef<[u8]>>(&mut self, key: K);

    /// Create a new empty batch
    ///
    /// This is used to create a fresh batch for collecting operations.
    fn default() -> Self;
}

/// Generic trait for key-value storage backends
///
/// This is the core storage abstraction that allows Metashrew to work with
/// different database implementations. It provides both mutable and immutable
/// operations, batch processing, and specialized features needed for blockchain
/// indexing.
///
/// # Design Principles
///
/// - **Generic**: Works with any key-value store that implements this trait
/// - **Atomic**: Supports batch operations for consistency
/// - **Efficient**: Provides prefix scanning for range queries
/// - **Extensible**: Includes hooks for tracking and monitoring
///
/// # Implementation Notes
///
/// Implementors should ensure that:
/// - Operations are thread-safe when required
/// - Batch operations are atomic
/// - Prefix scanning is efficient for the underlying storage
/// - Error types provide meaningful debugging information
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use metashrew_runtime::traits::{KeyValueStoreLike, BatchLike};
/// use anyhow::Result;
///
/// fn example_storage_usage<T: KeyValueStoreLike>(mut storage: T) -> Result<()> {
///     // Single operations
///     storage.put(b"key", b"value")?;
///     let value = storage.get(b"key")?;
///
///     // Batch operations
///     let mut batch = storage.create_batch();
///     batch.put(b"key1", b"value1");
///     batch.put(b"key2", b"value2");
///     storage.write(batch)?;
///
///     // Prefix scanning
///     let entries = storage.scan_prefix(b"prefix:")?;
///
///     Ok(())
/// }
/// ```
