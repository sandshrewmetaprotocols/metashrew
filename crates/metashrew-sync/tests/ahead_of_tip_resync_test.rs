//! v9.0.5-rc.15: a block AHEAD of the committed tip must not burn the retry
//! budget.
//!
//! Companion to `snapshot_path_stale_retry_test.rs`, which pins the OPPOSITE
//! direction. That test covers `height < current_height` — a block already
//! applied by a racing path — and the 2026-05 staleness guard fixed it.
//!
//! This test covers `height > committed_tip`, which nothing guarded and which
//! wedged mainnet three times (INCIDENT-REORG-WEDGE-20260816, -20260824, and
//! the 948955 event recorded in the sibling test).
//!
//! The distinction that matters, and the reason the earlier guard did not
//! catch this: the staleness guard compares the requested height against the
//! engine's IN-MEMORY `current_height`. The rejection actually raised by
//! `commit_atomic` compares it against the ON-DISK tip. When the cursor itself
//! has drifted ahead of the disk — which is exactly what a reorg does — the two
//! agree with each other and disagree with storage, so the guard sees nothing
//! wrong. Nothing in the codebase compared the cursor against the disk.
//!
//! Production shape (2026-08-24, `rockshrew-a-0`):
//!
//!   PROCESSOR: Failed block 963856 after 2577.178875719s
//!     commit_atomic at height 963856 exceeded max-retry budget (30 attempts):
//!     out-of-order commit rejected: attempted height 963856 but current tip
//!     is 963852 (commit_atomic only accepts height == tip + 1)
//!
//! ~43 minutes per block, re-learning on attempt 30 what was knowable on
//! attempt 1, while the fetcher marched further ahead and widened the gap.
//!
//! The invariant pinned here: when the requested height is ahead of the
//! committed tip, `process_block` must return the out-of-order error
//! PROMPTLY — not after 30 backoff rounds. Prompt return is what lets the
//! caller route it to `handle_reorg`, which rewinds the cursor.
//!
//! Without the rc.15 fix this test fails on the elapsed-time assertion: the
//! bounded retry loop takes minutes to give up.
