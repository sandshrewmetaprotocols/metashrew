//! Reproduces the metashrew_preview side-effect bug.
//!
//! Background — what preview() *should* do
//! ----------------------------------------
//! `MetashrewRuntime::preview(...)` is the host-side primitive used by
//! mempool simulation, alkanes_simulate, etc. The contract is: it executes
//! the indexer against a hypothetical block N+1 and returns a view-function
//! result, **without persisting any state changes**. After the call, the
//! production DB at height N must be byte-identical to its pre-call state.
//!
//! Inside preview(), the isolation primitive is:
//!
//!     let preview_db = guard.db.create_isolated_copy();
//!
//! and then `setup_linker_preview` wires that `preview_db` to the WASM
//! __flush host fn, which writes via `ctx.db.write(batch)` — the assumption
//! being that `ctx.db` is a snapshot/scratch DB nobody else reads from.
//!
//! What's actually happening
//! -------------------------
//! `KeyValueStoreLike::create_isolated_copy()` has a default implementation
//! in `crates/metashrew-runtime/src/traits.rs` that is just `self.clone()`.
//! `RocksDBRuntimeAdapter` (the prod adapter) does **not override it**. Its
//! Clone impl is `#[derive(Clone)]`, and its `db` field is `Arc<DB>` — so
//! "cloning" just bumps the Arc refcount. Both handles point at the same
//! physical RocksDB.
//!
//! Result: every `metashrew_preview` call writes its hypothetical state
//! changes into the production DB. When the indexed block actually lands
//! later, alkane contracts that store dedup keys (e.g. `/seen/<txid>`,
//! `/tx-hashes/<txid>`, `/upgraded_seen/<height>`) see the keys already
//! exist from the preview pass and revert with
//!     `ALKANES: revert: Error: transaction already processed`
//!
//! This explains the trace divergence we observed on alkanode where
//! Subfrost (which does not run preview heavily on the same DB) accepts
//! txs that alkanode reverts.
//!
//! This test
//! ---------
//! Directly exercises the `create_isolated_copy()` trait method on the
//! RocksDB adapter and asserts the contract: a write to the "copy" must
//! not be visible from the original. **It is expected to fail today** and
//! the failure is the bug. The fix is to override `create_isolated_copy`
//! on `RocksDBRuntimeAdapter` with a real implementation (an in-memory
//! overlay that reads through to the underlying DB but routes writes to
//! a per-preview HashMap) — or to change `setup_linker_preview` so it
//! never calls into `ctx.db` for writes at all.
