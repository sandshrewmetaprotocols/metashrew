//! # Core Trait Definitions for the Synchronization Framework
//!
//! This module defines the essential traits that enable the modular architecture
//! of the rockshrew-sync framework. These traits provide clean abstractions for
//! different components of a Bitcoin indexer, allowing for pluggable implementations
//! and comprehensive testing.
//!
//! ## Adapter Traits
//!
//! The framework uses the Adapter pattern to abstract external dependencies:
//!
//! ### [`BitcoinNodeAdapter`]
//! Abstracts communication with Bitcoin nodes, supporting various interfaces:
//! - **Bitcoin Core RPC**: Standard JSON-RPC interface
//! - **REST APIs**: HTTP-based block and transaction retrieval
//! - **Custom protocols**: Specialized node communication methods
//!
//! ### [`StorageAdapter`]
//! Abstracts persistent storage operations, supporting multiple backends:
//! - **RocksDB**: High-performance embedded database
//! - **PostgreSQL**: Relational database with ACID properties
//! - **Custom storage**: Application-specific storage solutions
//!
//! ### [`RuntimeAdapter`]
//! Abstracts WASM runtime execution for indexer modules:
//! - **Metashrew runtime**: Production WASM execution environment
//! - **Mock runtime**: Testing and development environment
//! - **Custom runtimes**: Specialized execution environments
//!
//! ## Service Traits
//!
//! ### [`JsonRpcProvider`]
//! Defines the external API interface for accessing indexed data:
//! - **View functions**: Query indexed data at specific heights
//! - **Preview functions**: Test indexing logic with hypothetical blocks
//! - **Metadata access**: Retrieve indexer status and configuration
//!
//! ### [`SyncEngine`]
//! Coordinates all components for complete blockchain synchronization:
//! - **Orchestration**: Manages the interaction between all adapters
//! - **State management**: Tracks synchronization progress and status
//! - **Error handling**: Provides robust error recovery mechanisms
//!
//! ## Design Principles
//!
//! ### Async-First
//! All traits use `async_trait` to support:
//! - **Non-blocking I/O**: Efficient resource utilization
//! - **Concurrent processing**: Parallel block processing capabilities
//! - **Scalable architecture**: Support for high-throughput indexing
//!
//! ### Error Handling
//! Comprehensive error handling through [`SyncResult`]:
//! - **Typed errors**: Specific error types for different failure modes
//! - **Error propagation**: Clean error bubbling through the call stack
//! - **Recovery strategies**: Information needed for error recovery
//!
//! ### Testability
//! Traits designed for easy testing:
//! - **Mock implementations**: Built-in mock adapters for testing
//! - **Dependency injection**: Easy substitution of components
//! - **Isolated testing**: Test individual components in isolation

/// Trait for Bitcoin node adapters that provide blockchain data.
///
/// This trait abstracts the interface to Bitcoin nodes, allowing the synchronization
/// framework to work with different node implementations and communication protocols.
/// Implementations can use Bitcoin Core RPC, REST APIs, or custom protocols.
///
/// # Implementation Requirements
///
/// Implementations must ensure:
/// - **Consistency**: Block hashes and data must be consistent across calls
/// - **Reliability**: Handle network failures gracefully with appropriate retries
/// - **Performance**: Optimize for batch operations when possible
/// - **Thread safety**: Support concurrent access from multiple threads
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// Methods should return [`SyncError::BitcoinNode`] for node-related failures:
/// - Network connectivity issues
/// - Invalid block heights or hashes
/// - Node synchronization problems
/// - RPC/API errors
#[async_trait]
